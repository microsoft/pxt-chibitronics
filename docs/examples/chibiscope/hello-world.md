# Hello World 
## @description Using Chibi Scope to print out a simple message string for @boardname@ 

## ~avatar avatar 
Let's use the Chibi Scope to create a message printout! 
## ~

## Materials: 
* 1 Chibi Scope 
* 3 Crocodile Clips 
* 1 @boardname@ 

## Duration: ~25 minutes 

## Step 1: Setting up your Chibi Scope

Use this link to setup the [Chibi Scope](/scope-setup) so you can program with it and display your text strings!

## Step 2: Hello World!  

* Open [MakeCode](@homeurl@) in your browser.
* From **CONTROL**, drag an **on start** loop and place it inside your workspace. 
* From **SCOPE**, place a **say message** inside your on start loop. 
* Type in `Hello, World!` 

```blocks
scope.writeLine("Hello World!")
```
Run your code, do you see the message appear on your Chibi Scope? 

Let's work on making your Chibi Scope display more! 

## Step 3: What's your name?

* From **SCOPE**, place a **say message** below your "Hello World!" block. 
* Instead of **adding text**, leave the box **blank**. This creates a line break for your Chibi Scope. 

```blocks
scope.writeLine("Hello World!")
scope.writeLine(" ")
``` 

* From **SCOPE**, grab another **say message** and place it inside. 
* This time, type `My name is...` and insert your name! 
* Finish this off with another blank message box. 

```blocks 
scope.writeLine("Hello World!")
scope.writeLine(" ")
scope.writeLine("My name is...")
scope.writeLine(" ")
``` 

Hmm, let's make our code do more...

## Step 4: Test... Test... Test...

* From **CONTROL**, drag a **forever** loop into your workspace. 
* From **SCOPE**, add a **say message** to your forever loop. 
* Type **Test...** into your message block. 

If you try running it now, what happens? The code prints out REALLY fast without any control. Let's add some space in between each print-out so that you can read at a manageable speed! 

* From **CONTROL**, grab a **pause** block and place it under your message block. Change the value to ``2000``. 

```blocks 
loops.forever(function () {
    scope.writeLine("Test...")
    loops.pause(2000)
})
scope.writeLine("Hello World!")
scope.writeLine(" ")
scope.writeLine("My name is...")
scope.writeLine(" ")
``` 

## Finished

Good work! Congratulations on finishing your first Chibi Scope activity.
