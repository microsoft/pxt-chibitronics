## Troubleshooting

### Try again!

The sound gets sometimes distorded by the computer, try again and you might be more lucky.

### Check your sound volume

Make sure your computer volume is all the way to 100% so that the board receives a clear sound.

### Check your Audio cable

Make sure the audio cable is in the headphone port, not the microphone.
