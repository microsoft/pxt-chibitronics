# pause

Pause a part of the program for some number of milliseconds.

```sig
loops.pause(400)
```

When code in a block comes to a ``||pause||``, it will wait the amount of time you tell it to. Code
in ``||forever||`` blocks will keep running while code in some other
block is waiting at a ``||pause||``.

## Parameters

* **ms**: the [number](/types/number) of milliseconds that you want to pause for. So, 100 milliseconds = 1/10 second, and 1000 milliseconds = 1 second.

## Example

Light up th3 `5` LEDs but wait one-half second before lighting each LED.

```blocks
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    lights.set(i, 1)
    loops.pause(500)
}
```
