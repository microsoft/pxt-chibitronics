# analog Write

Write a value of between `0` and `255` to make a signal at an analog pin.

```sig
pins.analogWrite(AnalogPin.A0, 255)
```

An analog output at a pin will have an amount of voltage related to the output value
you give to ``||pins:analog write||``. You are setting the amount of _signal_ at the pin.
You use values between `0` (for no signal) and `255` (for full signal). The actual voltage
on the pin will follow the value you give for the output. So, `0` is no voltage and `255`
is maximun voltage. The voltage that matches your signal value depends on the
voltage range used by your board.

## Parameters

*  **value**: a [number](types/number) between `0` (no signal) and `255` (full signal)


## Example

Create a sawtooth wave signal on pin `A0`.

```blocks
let i = 0
loops.forever(function() {
    i = 0
    while (i <= 255) {
        pins.analogWrite(AnalogPin.A0, i)
        loops.pause(100)
        if (i > 0) {
            i += 128
        } else {
            i += 127
        }
    }
})

```
